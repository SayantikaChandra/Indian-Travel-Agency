# Indian-Travel-Agency

The Indian Travel Agency, designed for providing an interface between the Company Administration and Employees, plays a critical role in between travel loving people & Tour Company Administration, besides offering controlled access to the database. The principal goal of a Travel Agency System is to provide the all kinds of help to the people who are interested to go for any tour at well-known place in India.

The Indian Travel Agency design is hinged on three-tier architecture:

	Client end, which consists of forms, options to select the desired beautiful places, hotels, total travel estimate, etc. designed using JAVA SWING.

	Business Logic at Server End, designed using Java class and Database connectivity with Oracle.

	Controller JDBC for switching control between Client end and Server Logic.
